**# -Next-Word-Prediction**

**Next Word Prediction (also called Language Modelling) is the task of predicting what word comes next. It is one of the fundamental tasks of NLP.

**Application Language Modelling
**1) Mobile keyboard text recommendation.**
**2) Whenever we search for something on any search engine, we get many suggestions and, as we type new words in it, we get better recommendations according to our searching context. So, how will it happen???****

**It is possible through natural language processing (NLP) technique. Here, we will use NLP and try to make a prediction model using Bidirectional LSTM (Long short-term memory) model that will predict next words of sentence.***
